# Advent of Code 2018

My entries, in Rust, for the 2018 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

## How to run
Download the input file and name it `inputs/dayX.txt`. Then, run the following for the first part of the problem:

```
cargo run --release --bin dayX-1 < inputs/dayX.txt
```

Changing `dayX-1` for `dayX-2` will run the second part of the problem.
