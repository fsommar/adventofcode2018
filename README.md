# Advent of Code 2018

These are my entries (in Rust) for the 2018 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

## How to run
Download the input file and name it `day_X_input.txt`. Then, run the following for the first part of the problem:

```
cargo run --release --bin dayX -- part1 < day_X_input.txt
```

Changing `part1` for `part2` will run the second part of the problem.
